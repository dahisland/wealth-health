# WEALTH HEALTH HRNET :

This project is the converted version in React of an outdated application used to HR management in
the Wealth Health company.
The old version was using Jquery plugins that affected performances.
This new version has been fully implemented with React.
Library components have been used to replace old plugins.
I developped my own library for one of them, published on official website [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
